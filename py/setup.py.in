The StromaV python package provides integration with Python execution
environment. While ROOT and Geant4 bindings have to be provided by appropriate
packages, the StromaV analysis and MC tools offers interfaces to authentic
C++ classes and routines.

Included tools may vary depending on specific StromaV configuration. Most
common configuration includes pipeline binding for events processing and
analysis.""" )
